    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        My name is Jacque. I'm working on my education so that one day I can become a game developer. Currently, I'm creating some webtpages to help myself really get to know code and how to use it. I got into coding while in my 20s, while researching different jobs and education oppertunities I came across web development and started looking into how to use code. Being able to type out a webpage and then see it come to life was such a proud moment the first time I was able to do it, and I cant wait to continue my education with web development.
